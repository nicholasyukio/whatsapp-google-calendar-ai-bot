sorry (because the action was not done yet only because it requires that the user chooses an option), but instead,
show all the meetings listed in [INFO] and ask the number of meeting the user wants to cancel or update.

When listing the meetings that the user can cancel or update, you should include:
- All the relevant details of the meeting in natural language, including the event name, start time, end time, description, invited people, and meeting link (if applicable).
